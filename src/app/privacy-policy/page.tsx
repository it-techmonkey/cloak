            Cloak ("we", "us", "our") is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what
            personal information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and your rights under the UK General Data

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>To provide the cloakroom pass service</strong> — processing your check-in, generating your QR

            </li>
          </ul>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>To communicate with you</strong> — sending service notifications, onboarding information, and
              support responses (lawful basis: legitimate interests, UK GDPR Art. 6(1)(f))
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. How long we keep your data</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Guest pass data</strong> — retained for 90 days from the date of the event, then deleted.
              Anonymised aggregate data (e.g. total items checked in) may be retained indefinitely.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Venue account data</strong> — retained for the duration of the venue's account, and for 12
              months after account closure, after which it is deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Authentication session data</strong> — deleted on logout or expiry, whichever is sooner.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Who we share your data with</h2>
          <p>
            We do not sell your personal data. We share data only with the following third-party processors, each
            bound by appropriate data processing agreements:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Supabase</strong> — our database and authentication infrastructure provider. Data is stored
              within the European Economic Area (EEA).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Resend</strong> — used to send transactional emails to venue operators.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Apple Inc. and Google LLC</strong> — when a guest adds their pass to Apple Wallet or Google
              Wallet, the pass data is transmitted to and stored by Apple or Google under their respective privacy
              policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stripe</strong> — payment processing for venue subscriptions, if applicable. Stripe handles
              payment card data under PCI DSS compliance; we do not store card details.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may also disclose data where required by law, court order, or to protect the rights or safety of
            our users or the public.
          </p>

          <h2>6. International transfers</h2>
          <p>
            Where any of our processors transfer data outside the UK or EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in
            place — such as the UK International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) or equivalent standard contractual
            clauses — in accordance with UK GDPR Chapter V.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
          <p>Under UK GDPR, you have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>

              processing

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Withdraw consent</strong> — where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw it at any
              time without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing
            </li>
          </ul>
